## Overview

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). The goal was to create a responsive NFT card with hover effects and semantic HTML structure.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Improved semantic HTML structure using section, article, header, and footer elements.
- Enhanced accessibility with ARIA attributes and descriptive alt text.
- Responsive design using CSS custom properties and media queries.
- **Note:** I was unable to change the color of `icon-view.svg` to white using CSS filters. The icon remains in its original color.

### Continued development

- Explore better ways to manipulate SVG colors for icons.
- Further improve accessibility and keyboard navigation.
- Experiment with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
